# Kafka-Saving-Lives
The project is developed collaboratively with my team, utilized Kafka, a distributed streaming platform, to implement a real-time navigation system for human transplants and perishable medicines. Among 11 competing teams, we achieved 3rd place overall.

This project combines the intuitive mapping capabilities of Google Maps with the robust data streaming capabilities of Kafka to collect and analyze traffic data in real-time. By leveraging the Google Maps Directions API, we retrieve up-to-the-minute traffic information, including estimated time of arrival (ETA), for specified routes. The collected data is then seamlessly transmitted to Kafka for further analysis or integration into larger systems.

Dependencies:
1. **Google Maps API Key**: Obtain a valid API key for the Google Maps API and integrate it into the script.
2. **Kafka Broker**: Set up a Kafka broker and define its address in the script.
3. **Python**: The script is written in Python, making it accessible and easy to understand.

This project leverages transformative power of technology in addressing critical challenges. By using Kafka, we have successfully implemented a real-time navigation system tailored to the unique needs of transporting human transplants and perishable medicines. This endeavor not only showcases our technical expertise but also underscores our commitment to making a tangible difference in the healthcare industry. As we continue to innovate and collaborate, we remain steadfast in our pursuit of leveraging technology to create positive impacts on society.
